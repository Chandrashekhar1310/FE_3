    "Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are both techniques used for encoding categorical variables in machine learning. However, they differ in how they assign numerical values to the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "   - In Ordinal Encoding, categories are assigned unique integers based on their order or rank.\n",
    "   - The assigned integers have an inherent order or hierarchy, meaning that the encoded values convey the relative order of the categories.\n",
    "   - For example, if we have three categories: \"Low,\" \"Medium,\" and \"High,\" they might be encoded as 0, 1, and 2, respectively. Here, the encoded values represent the order of the categories.\n",
    "   - Ordinal Encoding is commonly used when the categorical variable has a clear ordinal relationship among its categories, and that order is relevant for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Label Encoding:\n",
    "   - In Label Encoding, categories are assigned unique integers without any specific ordering or hierarchy.\n",
    "   - The assigned integers do not imply any order or relationship between the categories.\n",
    "   - For example, if we have three categories: \"Red,\" \"Green,\" and \"Blue,\" they might be encoded as 0, 1, and 2, respectively. Here, the encoded values are just arbitrary labels assigned to the categories.\n",
    "   - Label Encoding is typically used when the categorical variable does not have an inherent order, and the model should not assume any ordinal relationship among the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example usage:\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset containing a \"Temperature\" feature with categories \"Low,\" \"Medium,\" and \"High.\" If the temperature values have a clear ordering (e.g., \"Low\" < \"Medium\" < \"High\"), using Ordinal Encoding would be appropriate. The encoded values (e.g., 0, 1, 2) would preserve the information about the order of the temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if the \"Temperature\" feature represents different weather conditions, such as \"Sunny,\" \"Cloudy,\" and \"Rainy,\" there is no inherent order between these conditions. In this case, using Label Encoding would be more suitable, where the encoded values (e.g., 0, 1, 2) would act as arbitrary labels for the different weather conditions without implying any specific order."

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used for encoding categorical variables based on their relationship with the target variable. It assigns ordinal values to the categories based on the target variable's mean or median value for each category. The encoding is performed in such a way that it captures the monotonic relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the mean or median value of the target variable for each category of the categorical variable.\n",
    "2. Sort the categories based on their mean or median values.\n",
    "3. Assign ordinal values to the categories in ascending or descending order based on their sorted position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a machine learning project where we have a dataset containing a \"City\" feature and a target variable \"Sales.\" The \"City\" feature represents different cities where a product is sold, and we want to encode it using Target Guided Ordinal Encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the mean or median sales value for each city category:\n",
    "\n",
    "   City A: Mean Sales = $10,000\n",
    "   City B: Mean Sales = $8,000\n",
    "   City C: Mean Sales = $12,000\n",
    "   City D: Mean Sales = $9,000\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sort the cities based on their mean sales values:\n",
    "\n",
    "   City B < City D < City A < City C\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Assign ordinal values to the cities based on their sorted position:\n",
    "\n",
    "   City B: Encoded Value = 0\n",
    "   City D: Encoded Value = 1\n",
    "   City A: Encoded Value = 2\n",
    "   City C: Encoded Value = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, Target Guided Ordinal Encoding assigns ordinal values to the cities based on their mean sales values. The encoded values represent the relative performance of each city in terms of sales. This encoding can help the model capture the underlying relationship between the city and the target variable, potentially improving the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might choose to use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding in a machine learning project when you have a categorical variable where the categories exhibit a clear monotonic relationship with the target variable. By encoding the variable using this technique, you can preserve and utilize that relationship effectively in the model. It can be particularly useful in scenarios where the ordinality of the categories is meaningful and has a direct impact on the target variable."

    "Covariance is a measure of the relationship between two random variables. It quantifies how changes in one variable are associated with changes in another variable. In statistical analysis, covariance is important because it helps us understand the direction and strength of the linear relationship between two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The covariance between two variables, let's say X and Y, is calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cov(X, Y) = Σ[(Xᵢ - μₓ)(Yᵢ - μᵧ)] / (n - 1)\n",

    "where:\n",

    "- μₓ and μᵧ are the means of X and Y, respectively.\n",
    "- Σ denotes the sum of the products across all observations.\n",
    "- n represents the number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The covariance can take different values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Positive covariance: If Cov(X, Y) > 0, it indicates that when X increases, Y tends to increase as well. There is a positive linear relationship between the variables.\n",
    "- Negative covariance: If Cov(X, Y) < 0, it suggests that when X increases, Y tends to decrease. There is a negative linear relationship between the variables.\n",
    "- Zero covariance: If Cov(X, Y) ≈ 0, it implies that there is no linear relationship between X and Y. However, it does not necessarily mean that there is no relationship at all, as non-linear relationships may still exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnitude of the covariance is not standardized and depends on the scale of the variables. Therefore, it can be challenging to interpret the covariance alone. To overcome this, the correlation coefficient, which is derived from covariance, is often used. The correlation coefficient normalizes the covariance, providing a standardized measure between -1 and 1, indicating the strength and direction of the linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistical analysis, covariance is important because it helps us understand the relationship and dependency between variables. It allows us to assess whether changes in one variable are associated with changes in another, providing insights into how variables co-vary. Covariance is utilized in various statistical techniques, such as portfolio management, regression analysis, and exploratory data analysis, to assess the relationships between variables, identify patterns, and make informed decisions."

The categories have a natural order from \"High School\" to \"PhD,\" indicating increasing levels of education. By assigning numeric labels based on this order (e.g., 0 for \"High School,\" 1 for \"Bachelor's,\" 2 for \"Master's,\" and 3 for \"PhD\"), we can capture the relative education levels in the encoded values. Ordinal Encoding preserves the ordinal relationship and allows the model to learn from the order of the categories.\n",

One-Hot Encoding transforms each category into a binary column, where each column represents a category and has a value of 1 or 0 indicating the presence or absence of that category. Since there is no natural order between the employment statuses, One-Hot Encoding ensures that the model treats each category equally without imposing any order or hierarchy.\n",
